## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- MongoDB
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/conservatory-app-backend.git
   cd conservatory-app-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Environment Setup

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=development
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/conservatory-db
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
   REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_refresh_token_secret
   PORT=3000
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
   
   # For S3 file storage (optional)
   STORAGE_MODE=local  # Change to 's3' for AWS S3 storage
   S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
   S3_REGION=your-region
   S3_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
   S3_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```

4. Start the development server
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Initialize admin user
   ```
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/init-admin
   ```
   This creates an admin user with:
   - Email: admin@example.com
   - Password: 123456
